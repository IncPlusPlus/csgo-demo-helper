[demo_voice_helper]
; Leave at 1 if you want your own voice to be audible during demo playback (this does not affect the recording process)
playback_voice_player_volume=1
; Leave at 1 if you want demo recordings to include your voice but don't want to hear your own voice during the recording process.
; This will require playback_voice_player_volume to be set to 1 and this tool to be running to hear your voice during playback.

[demo_naming_helper]

; If you do want the word "competitive" attached to demos, set this to 1
explicitly_mark_competitive_demos=0
; Hides parts like "cs_" from the map name "cs_office". This helps keep file names a tad shorter
